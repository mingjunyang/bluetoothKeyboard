<p>This GAP profile manages bonded connections between devices.<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>When operating as a slave, this profile will automatically respond to SM Pairing Requests from a connected master device. When operating as a master, this profile will automatically respond to SM Slave Security Requests from a connected slave device.</p>
<p>After pairing, if keys were exchanged and bonding was specified, this profile will save the device and key information of the connected device, so that, on future connections, the bonded devices can establish an encrypted link without pairing.<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>This GAP Bond Manager will handle all of the pairing and bonding actions automatically and can be controlled by setting control parameters:<br/>
